                        <p>A French drain is an underground trench filled with gravel and a perforated pipe that collects and redirects subsurface water. It handles water throughout the soil. A catch basin is a surface drain with a grated top that captures water in one spot and channels it through solid pipes to a drainage point. French drains prevent water accumulation; catch basins remove water that's already pooled. Most effective systems use both.</p>

We design drainage systems specifically for clay conditions: deeper trenches, proper gravel selection, correct pipe placement, and adequate slope. Our solutions work WITH clay soil characteristics instead of fighting them.</p>
